# Gap_Tc_Paper
Data, plots and fits for superfluid gaps and critical temperatures in the BCS+HF and SRC approximations. This data is used in Ref.~[Eur J Phys A 58, 90 2020](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epja/s10050-022-00738-2) (also available at [arXiv:2202.07501](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07501)).
