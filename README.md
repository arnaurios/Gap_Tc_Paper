# Gap_Tc_Paper
Data, plots and fits for superfluid gaps and critical temperatures in the BCS+HF and SRC approximations

Folders:
1) fits > Python scripts for fitting data, and raw text files with fit results for pairing gaps and Tcs
2) figures > Python scripts to generate the figures in the paper. pdf files for these figures.
3) FiniteT_BCS > Results for gaps and Tc in the BCS approximation for N3LO
4) FiniteT_BCS_HF > Results for gaps and Tc in the BCS+HF approximation for N3LO and N3LO+3NF
5) FiniteT_SRC > Results for gaps and Tc in the SRC approximation for N3LO and N3LO+3NF and CDBONN
