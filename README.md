# Gap_Tc_Paper
Data, plots and fits for superfluid gaps and critical temperatures
Based on research by A Rios (ICCUB) and M Drissi (TRIUMF), Jan 2022

Folder structure:
1) Folder "fits" has fitting routines that employ Python
2) Folder "figures" has Python scripts to produce figures, and pdf files of figures in the paper
3) FiniteT_BCS > data for the BCS-only results with N3LO
4) FiniteT_BCS_HF > data for the BCS+HF results with N3LO and N3LO+3NF
5) FiniteT_SRC > data for the SRC-only results with N3LO, N3LO+3NF and CDBONN (not on paper)
